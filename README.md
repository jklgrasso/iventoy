Todo/questions:
- ventoy updator  (daily? weekly?)
- image updator
-FW updator
- system setup scripts
- Run on bare metal (Ubuntu server), or Proxmox, or just Pop?
  - Proxmox could build images and firmware on another ubuntu server instance. Although, this would be resource intensive. Could just setup to run updates on weekends, or downtime
- add preferred ISO check
